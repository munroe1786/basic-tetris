I followed along with Ania Kubow's YouTube tutorial to build this game.  It's a great resource for working with Javascript to build a game and just in general.

To play this game, clone and fork this repository.

Run 'open index.html' in the main directory to open the game in a web browser on your machine.

Have fun!
